Week 12|15 Final Exam & Capstone Project
In the last 3 weeks, we will explore a real industry capstone project and a final exam required for the certificate of completion. This is a free program, and no certificate will be provided upon completion. However, if anyone is interested in the certificate then they must take a comprehensive exam and capstone project and score at least 80%. $20 will be applied to cover the cost of the certificate.
